## Dataset: Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Speech Commands
https://zenkelab.org/resources/spiking-heidelberg-datasets-shd/

## main_tutorial.ipynb
This python notebook was made with Jupyter Notebook. We used example code from the dataset as a reference to download and process the dataset. We also used the snn torch tutorials: https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html. <br/> <br/> 
The datatset consists of audio data of numbers in German and English. The network is trained to classify those numbers.

### How to Run the Tutorial
Download and run on any .ipynb compiler. Make sure all of the necessary libraries are downloaded: SNN torch, pytorch, etc.

### To-Do and Possible Improvements
Adjust optimizer and parameters to increase the accuracy.
